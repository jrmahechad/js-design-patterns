# JS DESIGN PATTERNS
I create this repo to study Design Patterns using ES6 (EcmaScript 6).

# Creational Patters
These patterns offers object creation mechanisms according of the situation.

## Abstract Factory

- Provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- A hierarchy that encapsulates: many possible "platforms", and the construction of a suite of "products".

## Builder

- Separate the contruction of a complex object from its representation.
- The Same contruction process can create different representations.

## Factory Method

- Define a interface to create an object, but the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

## Prototype

- Specify the kinds of object to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying thes prototype.

## Singleton

- Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point to access it.

# Structural

These patterns identify a simple way to create relationships berween entities.

## Adapter

- Convert the intergace of a class into another interface that the client expects.
- Classes that couldn't work together because of incompatible interfaces now can do it.

## Bridge 

- Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
